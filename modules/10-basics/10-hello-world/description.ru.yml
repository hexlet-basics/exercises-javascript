name: Hello, World!
theory: |Traditionally, let's start with coding 'Hello, World!'. This program will display the text:

  <pre class = 'hexlet-basics-output'>
    Hello, World!
  </pre>

  To display something on the screen, you need to give the computer a special command. In JavaScript, this command is `console.log`.

instructions: |
  In the code editor, type in the following code letter by letter and click “Check”.

  `` javascript
  console.log ('Hello, World!');
  `` `

  Note: if you write `heLLo, woRld!` Instead of `Hello, World!`, this will be considered different text, because upper and lower case letters are different characters. The size of the letter is called _case_, and they say: _case is important! _ This applies to almost everything in the code, so get used to always pay attention to the char case.
