name: Hello, World!
theory: |
  As is tradition, we'll start by writing a 'Hello, World!' program. The program will print the following text:

  <pre class='hexlet-basics-output'>
    Hello, World!
  </pre>

  To print something, you need to give computer a special command. In JavaScript, we use `console.log()`.

instructions: |
  Copy the exact code from the instructions into the editor and run it by clicking “Run”.

  ```javascript
  console.log('Hello, World!');
  ```
  Note that if you type `hello, woRld!` instead of `Hello, World!`, it will count as different text, because upper and lowercase letters are different symbols in JavaScript. Letter size is called *case*, and any programmer will tell you that *case is important*. This rule affects almost everything in coding, so make sure you get used to paying close attention to the case at all times.
