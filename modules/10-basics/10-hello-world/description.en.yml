name: Hello, World!
theory: |
  To follow the tradition we'll start with writing a 'Hello, World!' program. The program will print following text:

  <pre class='hexlet-basics-output'>
    Hello, World!
  </pre>

  To print something, you need to give computer a special command. In the JavaScript language we use `console.log()`.

instructions: |
  Copy the exact code from the instructions into the editor and run it by pressing the “Run” button.

  ```javascript
  console.log('Hello, World!');
  ```
  Note that if you type `hello, woRld!` instead of `Hello, World!`, it will be counted as an absolutely different text, because in JavaScript capital and lowercase letters are different symbols. Letter size is called _case_ and in programming the frase _case is important_ is frequently used. This rule affects almost everything in code so get used to pay close attention to case.
