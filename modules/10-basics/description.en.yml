  Learning to program is a hard and a long process. And it's not limited to the syntax of a language. We would say that learning syntax is the easiest and the shortest step on the path, but we can't skip it. This Basics module is devoted to the basics of writing programs in JavaScript. It will serve as the basis for writing more complex programs later.
