name: Statements
theory: |
  A statement is a command given to computer to do something. The JavaScript code is a set of statements usually separated by a symbol `;`.

  Here is an example of code with two statements.

  ```javascript
  console.log('Mother of Dragons.');
  console.log('Dracarys!');
  ```

  When you run this code you will see two sentences on the screen, one after the other.

  <pre class='hexlet-basics-output'>
  Mother of Dragons.
  Dracarys!
  </pre>

  Theoretically, it's possible to put multiple statements on the same string:

  ```javascript
  console.log('Mother of Dragons.'); console.log('Drakarys!');
  ```

  but it's considered bad practice as it's difficult to read.

  Why is it good to know? A statement is an execution unit. An interpreter, the program which executes code in JavaScript needs such splitting. This interpreter in JavaScript world is any browser (as it's able to JavaScript code) or Node.js (for the same reason). The operation principle of an interpreter is (approximately) as follows. It reads the file with code, splits it into statements and then executes them.

instructions: |
  Print these three names, one after the other: "Robert", "Stannis", "Renly". As a result, the editor should print:

  <pre class='hexlet-basics-output'>
  Robert
  Stannis
  Renly
  </pre>

  Call `console.log()` for each name.
