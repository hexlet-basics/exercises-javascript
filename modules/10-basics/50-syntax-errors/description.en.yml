name: Syntax errors
theory: |
  If a JavaScript program isn't syntactically correct, the interpreter will show a relevant message and a note with a file and line where an error might have occurred. **Syntax errors** occur when the code has grammar mistakes. Grammar rules are important in human languages, but the lack of them won't affect your ability to read or understand any text. But in programming, everything should be strict. Even a tiny violation and your program will not run. A wrong parenthesis order, a `;` that you forgot to add â€” these are just some examples of such violations.

  Here is an example of code with a syntax error:

  ```javascript
  console.log('Hodor'
  ```

  If we run this code we will see the following message: `SyntaxError: missing ) after the argument list`. In JavaScript, such errors are called "SyntaxError". For technical reasons, such code running on [code-basics] (https://code-basics.com) will not show a note with a line and file. You can check this output on [repl.it] (https://repl.it).

  On one hand, syntax errors are the simplest because they are all about code grammar rules and aren't related to any code logic. They can be easily fixed, you just need to find them.

  On the other hand, interpreter will not always tell you the correct position of an error. Sometimes you need to add a forgotten bracket to another place as opposed to what the error message says.
