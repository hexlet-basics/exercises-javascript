Almost every programming language allows you to add comments to your code. An interpreter doesn't evaluate comments, their only purpose is to allow programmers to leave notes for themselves and others. There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:

**Single line comments** start with `//`.  Any text or symbols that follow, won't be evaluated or executed.

A comment can take up the whole line:

 ```javascript
// For Winterfell!
```

or can follow some code on the same line:

```javascript
console.log('I am the King'); // For Lannisters!
```

**Multiline comments** start with `/*` and end with `*/`.

```javascript
/*
  The night is dark and
  full of terrors.
 */
console.log('I am the King');
```

Such comments usually clarify the purpose of pieces of code.
