name: Some errors regarding variables
theory: |

  The order of statements in code with variables is tremendously important. You must declare a variable before using it. Below is an example of a common beginners mistake:

  ```javascript
  // Uncaught ReferenceError: greeting is not defined
  console.log(greeting);
  let greeting = 'Father!';
  ```

  Running the above program terminates with the error _ReferenceError: greeting is not defined_. _ReferenceError_ means that the code uses a name (called identifier) that is not defined. And the error itself explicitly tells you: _greeting is not defined_. Besides incorrect definition order, there are common typos in JavaScript, both when using a variable and when declaring it.

  It's the usage of a properly configured editor which reduces the number of such errors. Such an editor highlights names used without declaration and warns about possible problems.

  Another common mistake is trying to declare a variable that is already declared.

  ```javascript
  let greeting = 'Father!';
  let greeting = 'Father!';
  ```

  That's not an option. We'll have to create a new variable.

  Find an undeclared variable in the code and declare it by assigning the value 'Dragon';
