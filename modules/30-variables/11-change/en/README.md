The word "variable" itself suggests that it can vary. Indeed, the value of a variable can change throughout your code.

```javascript
let greeting = 'Father!';
console.log(greeting);
console.log(greeting);

greeting = 'Mother!';
console.log(greeting);
console.log(greeting);
```

The name remains unchanged, although it stores new data. Note the key difference between declaring a variable and changing it. The `let` keyword appears only when you create a variable, but when you modify it, you don't use a keyword.
