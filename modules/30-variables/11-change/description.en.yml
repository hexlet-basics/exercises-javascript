name: Variable change
theory: |

  The word "variable" itself suggests that it can vary. Indeed, the value of a variable can change throughout your code.

  ```javascript
  let greeting = 'Father!';
  console.log(greeting);
  console.log(greeting);

  greeting = 'Mother!';
  console.log(greeting);
  console.log(greeting);
  ```

  The name remains unchanged, although it stores new data. Note the key difference between declaring a variable and changing it. The `let` keyword appears only when you create a variable, but when you modify it, you don't use a keyword.

instructions: |

  In the exercise, the variable comes with an initial string value. Override the variable and assign it the same string, but reversed, i.e., place the characters of the initial string in reverse order.
