name: Variable change
theory: |

  The word "variable" itself suggests that it varies. Indeed, the value of a variable can change throughout your code.

  ```javascript
  let greeting = 'Father!';
  console.log(greeting);
  console.log(greeting);

  greeting = 'Mother!';
  console.log(greeting);
  console.log(greeting);
  ```

  The name remains unchanged although it stores new data. Note the key difference between declaring a variable and changing it. The `let` keyword appears only when you create a variable but modify it without a keyword.

instructions: |

  In the exercise, the variable comes with an initial string value. Override the variable and assign it the same string, but reversed; that is, place the characters of the initial string in reverse order.

definitions:
  - name: Variable
    description: is a means to save the data and name it for later use in the code.
