name: Magic numbers
theory: |

  Recall one of the previous lessons:

  ```javascript
  let dollarsCount = 50 * 1.25; // 62.5
  let rublesCount = dollarsCount * 60; // 3750

  console.log(rublesCount);
  ```

  From the developer's point of view, such code "smells". It means that the code is hard to comprehend. Even now, when you look at the numbers `60` and `1.25`, you are likely to ask: "What are those numbers?" And imagine reading it in a month! And how will a new programmer who hasn't seen the code before understand it? In our example, you reconstruct the context through proper naming, but in real life, the code is much more complicated and it is often impossible to guess the meaning of numbers.

  This "smell" is known as Magic Numbers. The numbers with an inexplicable origin, which you may restore only by digging deep into the code.

  A solution is simple: create variables with correct names, and everything will fall into place.

  ```javascript
  let dollarsPerEuro = 1.25;
  let rublesPerDollar = 60;

  let dollarsCount = 50 * dollarsPerEuro; // 62.5
  let rublesCount = dollarsCount * rublesPerDollar; // 3750

  console.log(rublesCount);
  ```

  Note the following details:

  * lowerCamelCase naming.
  * The two new variables are separated from the following computations by an empty line. These variables are meaningful apart from a computation, which is why this separation is appropriate: it improves readability.
  * The code is well named and structured, but it is longer than the previous version. It happens so often and that's okay. The code must be readable.

  You encountered a code printing the total number of rooms owned by the present king:

  ```javascript
  let king = 'King Balon the 6th';
  console.log(king + ' has ' + (6 * 17) + ' rooms.');
  ```

  As you can see, these numbers are magical: it is not clear what 6 and 17 are. If you know the history of the royal family, you can guess: each new king inherits all the ancestors' castles and builds a new one, an exact copy of his parents'.

  This strange dynasty simply breeds identical castles...

  Get rid of the magic numbers by creating new variables and print it.

  You get this:

  <pre class='hexlet-basics-output'>
  King Balon the 6th has 102 rooms.
  </pre>

  The variable names should provide the meaning of the numbers, but should be short and succinct enough to be readable.

  Note: the code will work with any name, and we always check only the printed result, so the task is up to you.
