name: Magic numbers
theory: |

  Let's remember one of the previous lessons:

  ```javascript
  let dollarsCount = 50 * 1.25; // 62.5
  let rublesCount = dollarsCount * 60; // 3750

  console.log(rublesCount);
  ```

  From the developer's point of view, such code "smells". It means that the code is hard to comprehend. Even now, when you look at the numbers `60` and `1.25`now, you might find yourself asking, "What are those numbers?" Imagine reading it in a month from now! How could a new programmer who hasn't seen the code before understand it? In our example, you can reconstruct the context through proper naming, but in real life, the code is much more complicated, and it is often impossible to guess the meaning of numbers.

  This "smell" is known as Magic Numbers. The numbers with an inexplicable origin, which you can only understand by digging deeper into the code.

  The solution is simple: create variables with the right names, and everything will fall into place.

  ```javascript
  let dollarsPerEuro = 1.25;
  let rublesPerDollar = 60;

  let dollarsCount = 50 * dollarsPerEuro; // 62.5
  let rublesCount = dollarsCount * rublesPerDollar; // 3750

  console.log(rublesCount);
  ```

  Note the following details:

  * lowerCamelCase naming
  * The two new variables are separated from the following computations by an empty line. These variables are meaningful even without a computation involved, which is why this separation is suitable here: it improves readability
  * The code is well named and structured, but it is longer than the previous version. It happens every so often and that's okay. The code must be readable

  You've come across some code printing the total number of rooms owned by the present king:

  ```javascript
  let king = 'King Balon the 6th';
  console.log(king + ' has ' + (6 * 17) + ' rooms.');
  ```

  As you can see, these numbers are magical: it is not clear what 6 and 17 are. If you know the history of the royal family, you can guess: each new king inherits all his ancestors' castles and builds a new one, an exact copy of his parents'.

  This strange dynasty simply breeds identical castles...

  Get rid of the magic numbers by creating new variables and print them.

  You'll get this:

  <pre class='hexlet-basics-output'>
  King Balon the 6th has 102 rooms.
  </pre>

  The variable names should give the meaning of the numbers, but should also be short and succinct enough to be readable.

  Note: The code will work with any name, and we only check the printed result, so the task is up to you.
