name: Chaining method calls
theory: |

  Numbers have a method that converts them to a string:

  ```javascript
  const peopleCount = 5;
  peopleCount.toString(); // '5'
  ```

  Will the following code work, and if so, what will it print?

  ```javascript
  const name = 'Tirion';
  console.log(name.length.toString());
  ```

   It's a first time we've seen several consecutive points notation, but all of the above operations here are familiar. Everything happening in this code is a merge of already known language features. This happens quite often in programming. Even if you don't know the syntax, you can try combining different approaches, and there is a good chance it'll work.

  The easiest way to understand how this code works is to break the chain into separate operations:

  ```javascript
  const name = 'Tirion';
  const len = name.length;
  console.log(len.toString());
  ```

  These examples are equivalent. We can perform operations sequentially, creating constants in between, or build a continuous chain of properties and methods. Computations in chains always go from left to right.

  One more example:

  ```javascript
  const name = 'Tirion';
  console.log(name.toUpperCase().toLowerCase());
  ```

  This kind of code requires a bit of mental effort. It's important to understand that `.toLowerCase()` applies to the result of the function call on the left. And `toUpperCase()` returns a string. Rookies often make mistakes in chains with methods forgetting to call a method:

  ```javascript
  const name = 'Tirion';
  // This code will work incorrectly.
  console.log(name.toUpperCase.toLowerCase());
  ```

  Following this idea, it's possible to build infinitely long (though, in this case, useless) chains:

  ```javascript
  // What is the result of such a call?
  console.log(name.toUpperCase().toLowerCase().length.toString().length);
  ```

  _This kind of trick won't work with functions because they are usually nested, f(f(f())), which complicates the analysis. Yet this doesn't mean that you can't do it nicely - you can and even should. Other languages implements it through a composition of functions or a pipeline operator, which, incidentally, is getting used in JavaScript: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator_

  Using the `slice()` method, get a part of a sentence assigned to constant `text` starting from `5th` to `15th` symbols. Process the resulting substring using the `.trim()` method and print the length of the final substring. Run these methods in a chain without intermediate variables.
