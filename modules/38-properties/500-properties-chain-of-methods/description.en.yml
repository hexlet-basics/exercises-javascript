name: Chaining method calls
theory: |

  Numbers have a method that converts them to a string:

  ```javascript
  const peopleCount = 5;
  peopleCount.toString(); // '5'
  ```

  Will the following code work, and if so, what will it print?

  ```javascript
  const name = 'Tirion';
  console.log(name.length.toString());
  ```

  It's the first time we've seen several consecutive periods, but all of the above operations here are familiar. Everything happening in this code is a mix of language features we already know. This happens quite often in programming. Even if you don't know the syntax, you can try combining different approaches, and there's a good chance it'll work.

  The easiest way to understand how this code works is to break the chain into separate operations:

  ```javascript
  const name = 'Tirion';
  const len = name.length;
  console.log(len.toString());
  ```

  These examples all do the same thing. We can perform operations sequentially, creating constants in between, or build a continuous chain of properties and methods. Computations in chains always go from left to right.

  One more example:

  ```javascript
  const name = 'Tirion';
  console.log(name.toUpperCase().toLowerCase());
  ```

  You'll need a bit of mental effort for this code. It's important to understand that `.toLowerCase()` is applied to the result of the `.toUpperCase()` function. And `toUpperCase()` returns a string. Rookies often make mistakes with chains of methods; they forget to call them:

  ```javascript
  const name = 'Tirion';
  // This code will work incorrectly.
  console.log(name.toUpperCase.toLowerCase());
  ```

  Following this idea, it's possible to build infinitely long (though, in this case, useless) chains:

  ```javascript
  // What is the result of this call?
  console.log(name.toUpperCase().toLowerCase().length.toString().length);
  ```

  _This trick won't work with functions because they are usually nested, f(f(f())), which complicates analysis. Yet this doesn't mean that you can't do it nicely - you can and should. Other languages implement it by composing functions or using a pipeline operator, which, incidentally, is starting to be used more and more in JavaScript: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator.

  Using the `slice()` method, get part of the sentence assigned to the constant `text`, starting from the `5th` character and ending on the `15th` character. Process the resulting substring using the `.trim()` method and print the length of the final substring. Run these methods in a chain without any intermediate variables.
