name: Properties and methods as expressions
theory: |

  Properties and methods are expressions along with variables, constants, or function calls, which means they can be combined in many different ways.

  In operations:

  ```javascript
  const name = 'Shaya';
  name.length + 5; // 10
  `hi, ${name.toUpperCase()}!`; // hi, SHAYA!
  ```

  In function parameters:

  ```javascript
  const name1 = 'Robb';
  const name2 = 'Shaya';
  console.log(name2.length); // => 5
  console.log(name2.toLowerCase()); // => shaya
  console.log(Math.min(name1.length, name2.length)); // => 4
  ```

instructions: |

  Print the first and the last letters of the sentence from the `text` constant in the following format:

  <pre class='hexlet-basics-output'>
  First: N
  Last: t
  </pre>

  Your task is to extract these characters from a string and paste them into `console.log()` without using any intermediate variables.
