name: Properties and Methods
description: |
  The data we use in our programs can have important properties. In JavaScript, properties are embedded directly into the language. In addition to properties, data has methods - functions that are inside properties. Properties and methods are the same expressions as variables, constants, or function calls, which means that they can be combined in many ways. These topics are explained deeply in separate courses dedicated to object-oriented features of JavaScript. Study the basics in this module.
