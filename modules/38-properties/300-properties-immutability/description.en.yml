  What will print the last call?

  ```javascript
  const name = 'Tirion';
  console.log(name.toUpperCase()); // => TIRION
  console.log(name); // => ?
  ```

  The answer to this question depends on how you understood the lesson about primitive data types' immutability. Calling the `.toUpperCase()` method returns a new value with all letters converted to uppercase but doesn't (and can't) change the original string. So inside a constant (or a variable, it doesn't matter here) will be the original `'Tirion'` value. This logic holds true for methods of all primitive types. Moreover, the attempt to change the value of a property of this data will lead to nothing:

  ```javascript
  const name = 'Tirion';
  console.log(name.length); // => 6
  name.length = 100;
  console.log(name.length); // => 6
  ```

  You can _replace_ the value with a new one instead of changing it. It requires variables:

  ```javascript
  let name = 'Tirion';
  name = name.toUpperCase();
  console.log(name); // => TIRION
  ```

  User input data often contains extra spaces at the end or beginning of a string. They are usually cut out with `.trim()`, for example, `'   hello\n '` becomes `'hello'`.
  Update the `firstName` variable by assigning the same value to it, but using the `.trim()` method. Print the result.
