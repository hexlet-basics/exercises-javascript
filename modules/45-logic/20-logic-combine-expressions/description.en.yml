name: Combination of logical expressions
theory: |

  Logical operations are expressions. So, you can combine them with other expressions.

  Let's say, for example, we want to check if a number is even, i.e., a multiple of two. In programming we do this:

    * check for a remainder when dividing by 2:
    * if the remainder is 0, then the number is even
    * if the remainder is not 0, then the number is odd

  The remainder of a division is an elementary but crucial concept of arithmetic, algebra, and even number theory and cryptography. The idea is simple: divide a number into several equal groups, and if anything remains, it's the remainder of the division.

  Split some candies equally among individuals:

  - 7 candy, 2 persons: 2 x 3 + **remainder 1**.
    So 7 is not a multiple of 2.
  - 21 candies, 3 persons: 3 x 7 + **remainder 0**.
    So 21 is a multiple of 3.
  - 19 candies, 5 persons: 5 x 3 + **remainder 4**.
    So 19 is not a multiple of 5.

  The `%` operator calculates the remainder of a division (not to be confused with division itself):

  ```javascript
  7 % 2;  // 1
  21 % 3; // 0
  19 % 5; // 4

  // Checking if even

  10 % 2 // 10 is even, i.e. remainder is 0
  9 % 2  // 9 odd, i.e. remainder is 1
  ```

  Write a function to check whether a number is even:

  ```javascript
  const isEven = (number) => number % 2 === 0;

  isEven(10); // true
  isEven(3);  // false
  ```

  In one expression, we've combined the logical operator `===` (equality check) and the arithmetic operator `%`.

  Arithmetic operators have higher priority than logical ones. So, we first calculate the arithmetic expression `number % 2`, and then its output is used in the logical comparison.

  Literally, it means the following: *"calculate the remainder of dividing `number` by 2 and check if the remainder equals zero; then return the result of the equality check "*.

  Another example: write a function to check the first letter of a string is uppercase.

  Algorithm:

  1. Get the initial character of the string and assign it to the variable
  2. Compare whether the character is equal to its uppercase version
  3. Return the result

  ```javascript
  const isFirstLetterInUpperCase = (string) => {
    const firstLetter = string[0];
    return firstLetter.toUpperCase() === firstLetter;
  };

  isFirstLetterInUpperCase('marmont'); // false
  isFirstLetterInUpperCase('Robb');    // true
  ```

  Write a function to check the format of a given phone number. If the number starts with *+*, then it's in the international format.

  ```javascript
  isInternationalPhone('89602223423'); // false
  isInternationalPhone('+79602223423'); // true
  ```
