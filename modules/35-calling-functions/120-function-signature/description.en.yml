name: Function signature
theory: |

  The `Math.pow()` function, which raises a number to any power, takes two parameters: **a number to raise** and **a power to raise**. If you call `pow()` without parameters, it returns `NaN`. The function honestly tries to perform exponentiation, but with no value passed, the interpreter automatically passes `undefined` to it. JavaScript forces programmers to be more careful than other languages. In most languages, if you pass fewer parameters to a function than it expects, an error will occur, but not in JavaScript. `NaN` will also return when passing any non-numeric values:

  ```javascript
  const result = Math.pow(2, 'boom');
  console.log(result); // => NaN
  ```

  Another function can have a different amount and type of parameters. For example, there may be a function that takes three parameters: a number, a string, and another number.

  How do we know how many parameters the `Math.pow()` function needs and what type the `return` will be? We took a look at the **signature** of that function. The signature defines the input parameters and their types, as well as the output parameter and its type. You can read about the `Math.pow()` function in [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/pow). In the "Syntax" section you see this:

  ```
  Math.pow(base, exponent)

  Parameters
    base
      The base number.
    exponent
      The exponent used to raise the base.
  ```

  It is a function signature and a short explanation. The documentation shows you how many arguments the function has and its type, whether the function returns something, and if so, what its return value type is.

  Now it's your turn to find the function signature in the documentation and figure out how to use it.

  There is a function in `Math` called `ceil()`. Study its [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/ceil).

  Write a program using the `Math.ceil()` function with a constant `number` and print the result.
