name: Calling functions
description: |
  Concept of function defines any arbitrary operation in programming. Functions are the bricks from which programmers build systems. In this module, you will learn how to use built-in functions. We will examine the function signatures in the documentation and figure out how to use it. We get familiar with standard libraries which provide thousands of functions. You canâ€™t memorize all the functions, so every programmer should know how to find documentation.
