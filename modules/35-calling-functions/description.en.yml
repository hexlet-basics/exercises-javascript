name: Calling functions
description: |
  Concept of function defines any arbitrary operation in programming. Functions are the bricks from which programmers build systems. In this module, you will learn how to use built-in functions. We will examine the function signatures in the documentation and figure out how to use it. We get familiar with standard libraries which provide thousands of functions. You can’t memorize all the functions, so every programmer should know how to find documentation.
