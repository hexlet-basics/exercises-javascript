name: Determinacy
theory: |

  Regardless of a programming language, functions possess some fundamental properties. Knowing these properties makes it easier to predict the behavior of functions, their testing, and their usage. These properties include determinacy. A function is called deterministic when it returns the same result for the same input parameters. For example, a function counting the number of characters is deterministic:

  ```javascript
  import { length } from 'hexlet-basics/string';

  length('hexlet'); // 6
  length('hexlet'); // 6

  length('wow'); // 3
  length('wow'); // 3
  ```

  No matter how many times we call this function with `'hexlet'` input, it will always return `6`. In turn, a function returning a random number is not deterministic, as the same input (even if it is empty, i.e. without parameters) will always output a different result. How it differs doesn't matter, even if at least one of a million calls returns something different, this function is deemed non-deterministic.

  ```javascript
  // Функция, возвращающая случайное число
  Math.random(); // 0.09856613113197676
  Math.random(); // 0.8839904367241888
  ```

  So what use to us knowing that? Determinacy seriously affects many facets. Deterministic functions are easy to work with, easy to optimize, easy to test. If you can make a function deterministic, you'd better make it one.

  Function `Math.random()` returns a random number from 0 to 1 with many decimal places. But in real tasks, you sometimes want to get random integers, for example, in the range from 0 to 10. Write the program returning exactly those numbers. To solve it you'll need [Math.random()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) and [Math.round()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/round)

  ## Algorithm

  Since `Math.random()` returns numbers in the range of 0 to 1, we need to multiply it by 10 to get numbers between 0 and 10. Then we round up the result to get what we need.
