name: Value return
theory: |

  Functions in JavaScript become really useful when they begin to return data instead of printing it. It allows to use them for further computations. Check out this example:

  ```javascript
  const message = greetHexlet();
  console.log(message);
  ```
  We assign a function output to the variable `message`. In order to make this code work, the function must use the `return` instruction inside of itself:

  ```javascript
  const greetHexlet = () => {
    const message = 'Hello, Hexlet!';
    return message;
  };
  ```

  `return` is a special statement that takes an expression right to it and sends it to an outside code where the function is called. The function execution stops here; any code after `return` doesn't carry out:

  ```javascript
  const greetHexlet = () => {
    const message = 'Hello, Hexlet!';
    return message;
    console.log('I will never execute');
  };
  ```

  You don't have to use a variable to return. Since `return` works with expressions, almost anything can follow it. Here we should keep to the principles of code readability:

  ```javascript
  const greetHexlet = () => {
    return 'Hello, Hexlet!';
  };
  ```

  A calculation example:

  ```javascript
  const doubleFive = () => {
    return 5 + 5;
  };
  ```

  But even if there is no `return` statement inside the function, it still has a return. By default, any function returns `undefined`. For example, the `console.log()` function prints text, but returns nothing. In that case, the return is `undefined`.

  ```javascript
  const result = console.log('You can put any text here');
  console.log(result); // => undefined

  // Or easier than ever, without creating an intermediate variable
  console.log(console.log('Wow')); // => undefined
  ```

  Why do we need such behavior? A function call is an expression, and an expression should always return a result, otherwise, there would always be errors in the code when there is no data to return.

  Self-check. What will it print?

  ```javascript
  // Definition
  const run = () => {
    return 5;
    return 10;
  }

  // Usage
  run(); // => ?
  ```

  Write a function returning a random integer from 0 to 10.

  ```javascript
  getRandomNumber(); // 1
  getRandomNumber(); // 9
  ```

  To accomplish this task, you'll need:

  [Math.random()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random)

  ```javascript
  Math.random(); // 0.2320000789855705
  ```

  [Math.round()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/round)

  ```javascript
  Math.round(2.320000789855705); // 2
  ```
