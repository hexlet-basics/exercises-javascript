name: Simplified function syntax
theory: |

  Compared to some (primarily functional) languages, the function definition in JavaScript looks rather cumbersome:

  ```javascript
  const square = (x) => {
    return x ** 2;
  };
  ```

  It uses a lot of extra characters and the word `return`. Since version ES6, an alternative, shorter syntax has appeared in the language, making it sometimes much easier to understand and shorten the code.

  ```javascript
  // It takes a little time to get used to it,
  // but after a while it'll become a must for you
  const double = (x) => x ** 2;
  ```

  There are two differences from the full definition: omitting the curly brackets and the `return` statement. The shortened syntax makes the return automatically. It means that there is exactly one computable expression inside such a function, and its result is immediately returned.

  Note that the differences are purely syntactic; there are no differences in terms of usage. An example with two arguments:

  The full version

  ```javascript
  const sum = (a, b) => {
    return a + b;
  };
  ```

  The shortened version

  ```javascript
  const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
  ```

  Note the absence of curly brackets. Developers unaccustomed to this syntax sometimes write `const sum = (a, b) => { a + b };` and then have a hard time understanding why it doesn't work. The answer is simple: if there are curly brackets, then this is not a shortened form, which means if you want the function to return a value, you will have to use `return`.

  Write the `capitalize()` function taking a non-empty string and converting the first letter of the first word to uppercase:

  ```javascript
  const name = 'arya';
  console.log(capitalize(name)); // => "Arya"
  ```

  To get a substring (or character) from a string, use the [slice()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice) method:

  ```javascript
  'welcome'.slice(2, 5); // "lco"
  ```

  To convert the string to uppercase, use the [toUpperCase()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase) method:

  ```javascript
  'welcome'.toUpperCase(); // "WELCOME"
  ```
