  Logical expressions allow you to answer questions that arise during program execution. Is the user authenticated? Is the subscription paid? Is it a leap year? In this module, you will learn predicate functions which pose the true/false question and answer it. We are going to practice writing these functions and move on to more complex logical expressions.
