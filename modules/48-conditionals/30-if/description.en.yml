name: Conditionals (`if`)
theory: |

  Conditional statements control the program's behavior depending on the conditions we want to test. They allow us to write complex programs that behave differently depending on the situation.

  Consider a function recognizing the type of a passed sentence. To begin with, it will distinguish between normal and question sentences.

  ```javascript
  const getTypeOfSentence = (sentence) => {
    const lastChar = sentence[sentence.length - 1];
    if (lastChar === '?') {
      return 'question';
    }

    return 'general';
  };

  getTypeOfSentence('Hodor');  // general
  getTypeOfSentence('Hodor?'); // question
  ```

  `if` is a construct controlling the order in which the statements are executed. It gets a predicate expression in parentheses and then defines a code black in curly braces. This code block executes only if the predicate is true.

  If the predicate is false, we skip the code block in curly brackets, and the function keeps executing. Here the next line of code, `return 'general';`, causes the function to return a string and terminate.

  As you can see, `return` can be anywhere in a function. Including the interior of a conditional code block.

  If the curly braces after `if` contains only one line of code, you can leave out the braces:

  ```javascript
  const getTypeOfSentence = (sentence) => {
    const lastChar = sentence[sentence.length - 1];
    if (lastChar === '?')
      return 'question';

    return 'general';
  };

  console.log(getTypeOfSentence('Hodor'));  // => general
  console.log(getTypeOfSentence('Hodor?')); // => question
  ```

  We advise against it and **always use curly brackets**. So you can clearly see where the conditional's body starts and ends. The code becomes smoother and more readable.

  Write the `guessNumber()` function to take a number and check if it's equal to a given number (let it be 42). If it's equal, the function should return the string `You win!'`; otherwise, it should return the string `'Try again!'`.

  ```javascript
  guessNumber(42) # 'You win!'
  guessNumber(61) # 'Try again!'
  ```
