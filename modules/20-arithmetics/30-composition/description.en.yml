theory: |
  Suppose we want to calculate an expression such as `3 * 5 - 2`. That is exactly how we would write it down:

  ```javascript
  console.log(3 * 5 - 2); // => 13
  ```

  Note that the interpreter performs arithmetic operations in right order: first division and multiplication, then addition and subtraction. Sometimes we want to change calculations order. We will dig into it in the next lesson.


  Or another example:

  ```javascript
  console.log(2 * 4 * 5 * 10);
  ```

   As you can see, we can combine operations, which allows you to compute even more complex compound expressions. To visualize how calculations are done inside the interpreter, let's look at an example: `2 * 4 * 5 * 10`.


  1. First we calculate `2 * 4` and get `8 * 5 * 10`.
  1. Then calculate `8 * 5` resulting in `40 * 10`.
  3. Finally, do the last multiplication and the result is `400`.

  We can combine operations, making it possible to compute increasingly complex compound expressions.

instructions: |

  Write a program that calculates and prints the value of the expression:

  ```
  8 / 2 + 5 - -3 / 2
  ```

  Don't calculate anything manually, your program should do all the calculations on its own.
