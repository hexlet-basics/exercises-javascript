name: Arithmetic operations
tips:
  - >
    Always indent arithmetic operators with spaces between the numbers
    (operands) - it is good form when programming. This is why we write
    `console.log(3 + 4)`, and not `console.log(3+4)` in our examples.
  - >
    The result of dividing by zero is Infinity. We will figure out what this
    means in later lessons.
