name: Loops
description: |
  Any code can be repeated thousands, millions, or even billions of times. This offers up a lot of possibilities for building programs and sophisticated systems when combined with the other tools you already know â€“ variables and conditions. Here's an obvious example. In a 500-page book, you must locate a specific phrase. The phrase is fresh in your mind, but you can't recall the page number. The quickest (and most time-consuming) method is to go through each page until you find the right one. Loops are required for such repetitive activities.
