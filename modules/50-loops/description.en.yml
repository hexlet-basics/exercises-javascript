  Any code can be repeated dozens, thousands, millions times. In combination with the other tools you already know – variables and conditions – this opens up many possibilities to build programs and complex systems. Here is a simple example.

The easiest (and the longest) way is to browse each page until you find the right one. Such repetitive actions require loops.
